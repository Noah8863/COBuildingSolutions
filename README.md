This is a front-end only eCommerce website created for a local business called "Colorado Building Solutions". This is the parent company for CBS-Lumber which I also developed and worked on. The project was worked on over a few months with multiple style overhauls and complete file/folder restructure with the introduction to React. The client and I worked with a UX designer named Tess Welch who came up with the final designs for the website. We all used a series of tools like Canva, Google Drive, Trello, and Email to communicate with each other and share ideas.
